For my capstone project, I want to try and figure out what cities are the fastest growing in the United States and what kind of businesses would be the best to start in those areas. 
I can use the Foursquare API to see what kind of venues are most popular in the fastest growing cities or regions, so I can suggest a type of category to interested entrepreneurs.
